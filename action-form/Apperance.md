## Background

The form background can be solid color, pattern or cover image and these options are best used with the Text Color options which will give a nice effect to the form if you don't want to remain to the standard default options. The usability of these settings is that you don't need to write code for each form when wanting to customize it, you just have to use these drop down lists from where you can select the option which suits you. Among the themes, background color, text color, there's also the possibly to change the padding - you can enlarge the space between the forms and the surrounding elements.

## Label Align

The Label Align property allows you to align the labels on the action forms. The labels are the title names for the text boxes, for example "Last Name" and "First Name". You can position the labels to the Left, Right, Center, Top, Inside. Note that the position is displayed on the space allocated in the <b>Label Width</b>. To select a position for your labels, select from the Label Align drop down box and specify the position.

## Label Width

The Label Width property allows you to specify the width of the label columns on the action form. It controls the space allocated for labels, so it can display the labels closer or farther from the controls. This option ensures the responsive layout according to each setting. Make sure that you select an option which provides sufficient space, does not overlap the labels or insert a wide space between the labels and the text box.
