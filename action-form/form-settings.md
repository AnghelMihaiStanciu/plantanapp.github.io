# Form Settings

The **Action Form** settings, highlighted on the image below, allows you to configure the layout and appearance of the form. These settings are managed in the General Settings section. 

More info on how to change the look & feel of forms, you will find under <a href="/action-form/Apperance.html">Appearance</a> and <a href="/action-form/form-layout.html">Form Layout</a> sections.

The **Action Form** module is highly configurable so it can be set on every website with different designs. Thanks to the newest feature addition **Embed** the Action Form module can now be used on any website out there based on any CMS and platform configuration:
* DNN (aka dotnetnuke)
* WordPress
* Joomla!
* Drupal
* Shopify
* PrestaShop
* Magento
* pretty much anything that takes standard HTML code and is able to display an iframe

> The feature was introduced in Action Form 5.0.275 and is available in all versions released afterwards that are activated with an *Enterprise* or *Developer* licence type.
