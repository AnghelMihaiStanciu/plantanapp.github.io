# Developer Documentation

## About this documentation

This documentation is intended for people developing on the Plant an App platform. It can either be used as a manual and read from start to end or as a reference by using the search function and the menus. 

It's structured as follows:
 - **Modules**: These are the blocks used to build the application, such as forms, grids, APIs and so on.
 - **Actions**: These represent the logic of the applications. Actions can be used to build workflows that are triggered based on user actions (such as a button click), on API calls or on scheduled tasks. 
 - **Add-ons**: These are extensions to modules. They are separated from modules because they represent very specific functionality (for example Barcode generation) and have their own development cycles.
 - **Integrations**: Similar to add-ons, except these refer to integrations with 3rd party services and products, such as Excel, Mailchimp, Clickatel, Paypal and so on.
