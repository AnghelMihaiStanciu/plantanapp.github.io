# Update Mailchimp member GDPR properties

This action will alow you to update a member's GDPR preferences ([mailchimp marketing permissions](https://developer.mailchimp.com/documentation/mailchimp/reference/lists/members/)) in your Mailchimp list

For the action to work, it needs to have:

* API key
* list name
* email to which the changes apply (has to be already in the list)
* and the list of values to be passed Enabled/Disabled(True/False) for each marketing (GDPR) permission name (as in mailchimp)
