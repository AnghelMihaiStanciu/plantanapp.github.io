# Stripe Recurring Payments

Starting with version 5 the Stripe Add-on includes actions that will allow you to create recurring payment profiles and assign customers to them.

The actions are:
* [**Create Plan**](/integrations/stripe/recurring-payments/stripe-create-plan.html) which creates a Recurring Payment profile
* [**Create Customer**](/integrations/stripe/recurring-payments/stripe-create-customer.html) which creates a Stripe customer profile for your user (consider it a way of saving customer's Credit Card information in a highly secured area on Stripe's platform)
* [**Create Subscription**](/integrations/stripe/recurring-payments/stripe-create-subscription.html) which helps with linking an existing Stripe customer profile to an existing plan(recurring payment profile)

> Create Customer action was introduced in Stripe Add-on version 5.0.25
