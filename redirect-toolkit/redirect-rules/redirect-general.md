# Redirect General Info

In this section you have to provide a short description and to specify priority of your redirects.

Firstly, in *Title* section you need to provide a descriptive label in order to identify the redirect and its purpose. Then you  have to define priorities in *Priority* section. There are two option available:

* Highest Priority
* Lowest Priority

The option *Evaluate For All Requests*  if it is set the rule will be evaluated globally for all HTTP requests on all pages. Because of this, JavaScript redirects will not work.

*Enabled Option* has the role to disable rules so they no longer are executed but you can re-enable them later.
