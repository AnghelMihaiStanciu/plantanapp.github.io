# Browser Information

This is probably the most versatile type of redirect available in Redirect Toolkit. There are two sides of this redirect:

* Browser Information (name, version, *declared capabilities*, etc)
* Device Detection - Problem with this the lack of a standard where devices would just send a flag (saying *I'm a device*) to the server. So it's up to the server to somehow figure out if the call was made by a mobile device.

There are two methods used to detect mobile devices:

* Database method - User agent string is tested against a database with all devices that exist in the world; this method is the safes one but adds a heavy footprint to the application
* The regular expression method implies matching known parts of the user agent string. This is the method that Redirect Toolkit uses and further more it provides a mechanism to extend the detection with new devices. This is done by adding your own regular expressions to file */DesktopModules/avt.RedirectToolkit/MobileDeviceRegEx.xml* or let us know about the device and will get it included in the core regular expression.
